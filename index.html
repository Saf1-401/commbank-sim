    <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>
    <h2>Strong Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      Use complex, unique passwords for each account and change 
      your passwords regularly. Add a second layer of protection 
      by enabling two-factor authentication wherever possible.
    </p>

    <h2>Internet Safety</h2>
    <p>
      Connecting to public hotspots can be risky. Due to the lower 
      security, hackers may intercept your information. Refrain 
      from clicking any links that have been sent to you. Instead 
      navigate to the official website yourself to avoid potential 
      malware. Moreover, make sure the sites you do visit are secure. 
      Avoid having additional tabs to other sites open as there is a 
      risk of session stealing.
    </p>

    <h2>Device Security</h2>
    <p>
      Stay up to date with the latest computer security software for 
      protection against virus', spam, spyware, etc. When using a 
      device that is not yours, there could potentially be software 
      that captures authentication information, so make sure to delete 
      your cache and history.
    </p>

    <h2>Safeguard Account</h2>
    <p>
      Review your account activity and statement thoroughly and on a 
      regular basis, and make sure that all your details are correct 
      and up to date. Immediately notify the relevant institution if 
      you spot any unauthorised activity.
